# Divide-And-Conquer Algorithm

This is a project I completed while taking "Stanfordx: Algorithms Design And Analysis, Part I" on Coursera. The purpose of this project is to allow students to practice coding up the divide-and-conquer algorithm, and apply it to compute the number of inversions among 100,000 unsorted integers.

The java codes I wrote are in the src folder.
